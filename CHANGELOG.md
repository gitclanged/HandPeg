# Changelog

Release notes for HandPeg, newest first. Notes for 2.1.0 and earlier are on the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/gitclanged/HandPeg/releases).

## HandPeg v2.2.0

### Highlights
- **Editor Mode gets its height back.** The top bar is gone in Editor Mode, so the player and timeline take the full height of the window. Project, Queue, Video Combinator, the mode switch, Panes and Settings sit in one row at the top of the side column, and the source box has a pane of its own.
- **One set of encoder controls for every encoder.** A single Encoder Preset box and a single Rate Control box serve software, NVENC, AMF and QuickSync, and the hardware options sit inline in the main panel instead of in separate vendor panels.
- **Layer and clip audio in Live Preview.** Sound from video layers and added audio clips is mixed into the player while it plays, instead of only being heard in the export.
- **Subtitle preview no longer slows the player.** Styled auto-captions are now drawn by the player itself rather than rasterized on the CPU for every frame, which fixes the scrubbing lag and stutter on long videos.
- **NVENC on older NVIDIA cards.** HandPeg now detects a driver that is too old for the newest FFmpeg and switches to the FFmpeg 8.1 build, which keeps NVENC working on the GTX 10 series.

### New
- Source pane (Editor Mode): a full-width path or URL box with an inline button that reads **Browse** while the box is empty and **Load** once it holds something. Enter does the same. Download Resolution sits on the pane's title row. Show or hide it from the Panes menu.
- AMF: Usage (transcoding, low latency and so on) and 10-bit output.
- QuickSync: ICQ rate control, lookahead with depth, and 10-bit output.
- 10-bit output for software encoders (`yuv420p10le`).
- Rate Control lists only the modes the selected encoder has: CRF, CQ, CQP or ICQ, plus CBR and VBR.
- NVENC presets are labelled, e.g. `p1 (Fastest)` to `p7 (Highest Quality)`; AMF presets read Speed, Balanced and Quality.
- Each hardware encoder is probed on its own, and so are the features that depend on the card's generation (temporal AQ, 10-bit, B-frames). Options the card refuses are disabled instead of failing the encode.
- Settings → Update URLs → **Install FFmpeg 8.1 instead of the newest build (for older NVIDIA drivers)**. Turned on automatically when NVENC fails to start because of the driver version.
- Chapters are on the Video tab in Editor Mode, under Resolution & Cropping.
- The full Filters tab, including colour grading, is available in Encoder Mode.

### Changed
- Editor Mode has no top bar. Encoder Mode keeps its top bar exactly as before.
- The side column stays open in Editor Mode and cannot be dragged narrower than its row of header buttons, so the buttons never wrap or clip.
- The Panes menu opens from the header in Editor Mode.
- Automation rules moved from a tab in the main window to Settings → Automation.
- The NVENC, AMF and QuickSync panels are gone; Multipass, Usage, Lookahead, Spatial/Temporal AQ and 10-bit appear in one row and only for the encoders that have them.
- Preview Subtitles no longer switches Live Preview on; it works with Live Preview off.
- Paste & Load is removed in Editor Mode. Paste into the source box and press Enter.

### Fixed
- Scrubbing latency and playback stutter with Preview Subtitles on, worst on long videos.
- One hardware encoder failing its test (for example AV1 on a card without it) hiding the others.
- NVENC unavailable on GTX 10-series and older cards with the newest FFmpeg.
- Hardware encoder failures left no trace: FFmpeg's error output is now written to `HandPeg.log`, as is the reason for each fallback to software.
- 10-bit H.264 on QuickSync silently encoding as 8-bit. It is now reported as unsupported.
- Software fallback keeping hardware-only options (`-usage`, `-look_ahead`, `-look_ahead_depth`) that stopped the retry.

### Compatibility
- 2.1.0 projects and presets open unchanged. NVENC lookahead and 10-bit settings in older encoding presets carry over to the unified options.
- Encoding presets saved in 2.2.0 still load in 2.1.0, but lose AMF Usage, QuickSync ICQ, and lookahead and 10-bit on encoders other than NVENC.
- On first launch the Source pane is opened in every saved layout, and colour grading is switched on in Encoder Mode.

### Known limitations
- Live Preview audio plays layer and clip sound only while playing forwards. It is silent while scrubbing, in reverse shuttle and when a track is soloed, and it leaves out cuts, fades, track filters, ducking and voiceover. The export is unaffected.
- The Source pane can be shown and hidden but not dragged or reordered like the other panes.
- No speed control on the main video.
- Only the first audio stream of a video layer is used.
- Opacity can't be keyframed yet.
- Undo covers the timeline only.

### Upgrading
Installed copies update automatically.
**GTX 10-series and older NVIDIA cards:** after updating, let HandPeg run its FFmpeg update once (Settings → Tools). It installs the FFmpeg 8.1 build and NVENC returns on the next encoder check.
